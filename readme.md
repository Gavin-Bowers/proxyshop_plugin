Updated for 1.14
Settings now work!

The settings are configured to be as accurate as possible by default. However, the template has some differences from real cards for quality reasons.
* Textboxes are cropped in slightly to remove the bevel, and it's recreated in photoshop. This is to give more control and get cleaner lines
* The dual land textboxes were created by color grading the basic land textboxes to match the dual lands. This allows me to make dual lands programmatically
* The textboxes for artifact and blue cards are AI upscaled, since the results were so good, and they really benefitted from the added quality
* Colorless cards from MH3 are implemented as a filter for artifact cards. I did this for greater flexibility. I also changed the textbox color overlay to align with edges of the bevel. The overlay on the actual cards doesn't, and it looks bad. I don't get why they did it that way
* The pinline color for red lands is based on 7th edition while the others are from CMM, because the CMM mountain is weirdly desaturated
* I didn't include the old basic land watermarks. The watermarks added by Proxyshop are the modern ones which are different
